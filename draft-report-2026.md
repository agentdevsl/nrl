## DRAFT FORMAT

> **Critical context:** In an ordered draft, "You" picks LAST in every single round — always getting the 10th-best available player. Flaps picks FIRST in every round — always getting first choice. This compounding advantage/disadvantage over 17 rounds is enormous.

## ROUND-BY-ROUND ANALYSIS

### ROUND 1 (Picks 1-10)

| Pick | Team | Player | Verdict |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Flaps | James Tedesco | DISASTER |
| 2 | Cims | Nathan Cleary | CORRECT |
| 3 | Badgers | Reece Walsh | CORRECT |
| 4 | Sards | Payne Haas | REACH |
| 5 | Grunts | Terrell May | QUESTIONABLE |
| 6 | Fobs | Nicho Hynes | FAIR |
| 7 | Shufflers | Scott Drinkwater | FAIR |
| 8 | Swans | Jayden Campbell | FAIR |
| 9 | Mogpeats | Tom Trbojevic | STEAL |
| 10 | You | Tino Faasuamaleaui | FAIR |

**Pick 1 — Flaps — James Tedesco:** The number 1 overall pick and you've taken a 32-year-old declining fullback when Nathan Cleary — the best player in world rugby league — is RIGHT THERE. This doesn't just hurt Flaps, it gifts Cleary to Cims at pick 2. In an ordered draft where Flaps pick first EVERY round, this compounds catastrophically.

**Pick 4 — Sards — Payne Haas:** A prop at pick 4 when Kalyn Ponga and Nicho Hynes are still available. You can find a serviceable prop at pick 40. You can't find Ponga or Hynes at pick 40. Wrong position, wrong pick.

**Pick 9 — Mogpeats — Tom Trbojevic:** Turbo falling to pick 9 is a miracle. Eight teams let him go. Yes, injury risk — but from pick 9, the risk-reward is outstanding.

**Pick 10 — You — Tino Faasuamaleaui:** Last pick of R1. Every premium spine player is gone — Cleary, Walsh, Hynes, Trbojevic, Ponga, Drinkwater, Campbell. Faasuamaleaui is the best available forward and a genuine leader. Sensible pick from the worst seat in the house.

> **Round 1 Winner:** Mogpeats — Turbo at 9
> **Round 1 Loser:** Flaps — Tedesco at 1 over Cleary

---

### ROUND 2 (Picks 11-20)

| Pick | Team | Player | Verdict |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 11 | Flaps | Herbie Farnworth | CRIMINAL |
| 12 | Cims | Keano Kini | QUESTIONABLE |
| 13 | Badgers | Harry Grant | GOOD |
| 14 | Sards | Mark Nawaqanitawase | DISASTER |
| 15 | Grunts | Kalyn Ponga | GOOD |
| 16 | Fobs | Jacob Kiraz | TERRIBLE |
| 17 | Shufflers | Jahrome Hughes | GOOD |
| 18 | Swans | Latrell Mitchell | GOOD |
| 19 | Mogpeats | Sam Walker | GOOD |
| 20 | You | Dylan Edwards | BEST AVAILABLE |

**Pick 11 — Flaps — Herbie Farnworth:** FIRST PICK of round 2. Kalyn Ponga is available. Sam Walker is available. Latrell Mitchell is available. Harry Grant is available. Cameron Munster is available. And you've taken... Farnworth? A CENTRE? With first pick in the round? After already butchering pick 1 with Tedesco, you've now passed on five or six future representative players for a centre who makes 150 metres a game. This is BACK-TO-BACK catastrophic decisions with the best possible draft position.

**Pick 14 — Sards — Mark Nawaqanitawase:** Ponga is still on the board. Mitchell is still on the board. Walker is still on the board. Hughes is still available. And you've taken a rugby union convert who's played a handful of NRL games. At pick 14. This is the biggest reach in the draft. Ponga went ONE PICK LATER at 15 — the Sards let Ponga walk for Nawaqanitawase. Unforgivable.

**Pick 16 — Fobs — Jacob Kiraz:** Mitchell is STILL available at 18. Walker is STILL available at 19. And you've gone Kiraz. A solid centre, sure — at pick 36 or 46. Not pick 16. You've gifted Mitchell and Walker to the teams behind you.

**Pick 20 — You — Dylan Edwards:** Last pick of R2. By now Farnworth, Kini, Grant, Nawaqanitawase, Ponga, Kiraz, Hughes, Mitchell, and Walker are all gone. Edwards — a premiership-winning fullback — is the best player left on the board. Smart, composed pick. You can't control what the 9 teams before you do. You can control taking the best available — and you did.

> **Round 2 Winner:** Mogpeats — Walker at 19
> **Round 2 Loser:** Flaps — Farnworth at 11 over Ponga/Walker/Mitchell/Grant

---

### ROUND 3 (Picks 21-30)

| Pick | Team | Player | Verdict |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 21 | Flaps | Valentine Holmes | MISTAKE |
| 22 | Cims | Cameron Munster | GOOD |
| 23 | Badgers | Sione Katoa | MISTAKE |
| 24 | Sards | Taylan May | FAIR |
| 25 | Grunts | Blayke Brailey | GOOD |
| 26 | Fobs | Dylan Lucas | ANOTHER BACK |
| 27 | Shufflers | Ezra Mam | GOOD |
| 28 | Swans | Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow | GOOD |
| 29 | Mogpeats | Joseph Tapine | EXCELLENT |
| 30 | You | Jamal Fogarty | LIMITED OPTIONS |

**Pick 21 — Flaps — Valentine Holmes:** FIRST PICK again. Cameron Munster is available — a genuine Test five-eighth. And you've taken Valentine Holmes. THREE rounds with first pick and you've gone Tedesco, Farnworth, Holmes. You could have Cleary, Ponga, Munster. Let that sink in.

**Pick 23 — Badgers — Sione Katoa:** You have Walsh and Grant — the best 1-9 combo in the draft. You need a HALF. Ezra Mam is available at 27. Matt Burton, Thomas Dearden, Daly Cherry-Evans are all out there. Instead — a centre. The Badgers never find a halfback. This is where it dies.

**Pick 30 — You — Jamal Fogarty:** Last pick of R3. By now Cleary, Walsh, Hynes, Munster, Drinkwater, Mam, Hughes are all gone. The quality halves cupboard is bare. Cherry-Evans, Burton, and Dearden are still available but "You" can't know they'll last until pick 40. Fogarty is a pragmatic pick from the worst position — limited, yes, but the board forced it.

> **Round 3 Winner:** Mogpeats — Tapine at 29
> **Round 3 Loser:** Flaps — Holmes at 21 over Munster

---

### ROUND 4 (Picks 31-40)

| Pick | Team | Player | Verdict |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 31 | Flaps | Casey Mclean | WEAK |
| 32 | Cims | Stephen Crichton | GOOD |
| 33 | Badgers | Keaon Koloamatangi | GOOD |
| 34 | Sards | Jacob Preston | REACH |
| 35 | Grunts | Fletcher Sharpe | WEAK |
| 36 | Fobs | Isaiah Iongi | 4TH BACK |
| 37 | Shufflers | Reuben Garrick | REDUNDANT |
| 38 | Swans | Kayal Iro | OVERPAY |
| 39 | Mogpeats | Hudson Young | GOOD |
| 40 | You | Alexander Brimson | UNDERSTANDABLE |

**Pick 31 — Flaps — Casey Mclean:** Four rounds of first picks: Tedesco, Farnworth, Holmes, Mclean. Meanwhile Stephen Crichton, Keaon Koloamatangi, Patrick Carrigan, David Fifita are available. This drafter is allergic to quality forwards.

**Pick 39 — Mogpeats — Hudson Young:** Spine complete in four rounds. Tom Trbojevic, Sam Walker, Joseph Tapine, Hudson Young. Every other team is still scrambling.

**Pick 40 — You — Alexander Brimson:** Here's where I need to correct myself from the snake draft analysis. In an ordered draft, Young went at pick 39 to Mogpeats — ONE PICK before "You." They literally COULDN'T have taken Young. By pick 40, the quality playmakers available have been picked clean by nine teams. Daly Cherry-Evans (went at 48) and Matt Burton (went at 59) were still on the board — Cherry-Evans would've been the better pick — but Brimson as a second playmaker from the last seat is understandable. Not great, but not the catastrophe I originally called it.

> **Round 4 Winner:** Mogpeats — Young at 39, spine complete
> **Round 4 Loser:** Flaps — Mclean at 31 with first pick

---

### ROUND 5 (Picks 41-50)

| Pick | Team | Player | Verdict |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 41 | Flaps | Beau Fermor | WEAK |
| 42 | Cims | Lehi Hopoate | REACH |
| 43 | Badgers | Patrick Carrigan | GOOD |
| 44 | Sards | Isaah Yeo | GOOD |
| 45 | Grunts | Jaydn Su'A | RISKY |
| 46 | Fobs | Brian Too | 5TH BACK |
| 47 | Shufflers | David Fifita | GOOD |
| 48 | Swans | Daly Cherry-Evans | GOOD |
| 49 | Mogpeats | Addin Fonua-Blake | EXCELLENT |
| 50 | You | Erin Clark | FAIR |

**Pick 41 — Flaps — Beau Fermor:** FIVE first-picks in a row and still no halfback. Still no quality forward. Fermor is a fringe back-rower. From first pick this is disgraceful.

**Pick 49 — Mogpeats — Addin Fonua-Blake:** Two Test-calibre props (Joseph Tapine and Addin Fonua-Blake) from picks 29 and 49. The middle of this pack will bulldoze anyone.

**Pick 50 — You — Erin Clark:** Last pick again. The premium forwards are long gone. Clark is serviceable. At pick 50, you take what's left.

> **Round 5 Winner:** Mogpeats — Fonua-Blake at 49
> **Round 5 Loser:** Flaps — five rounds of first picks, no half, no quality forward

---

### ROUND 6 (Picks 51-60)

| Pick | Team | Player | Verdict |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 51 | Flaps | Daniel Tupou | TERRIBLE |
| 52 | Cims | Toby Couchman | WEAK |
| 53 | Badgers | Paul Alamoti | FAIR |
| 54 | Sards | Lachlan Galvin | WEAK |
| 55 | Grunts | Thomas Dearden | NEEDED |
| 56 | Fobs | Blaize Talagi | 6TH BACK |
| 57 | Shufflers | Haumole Olakauatu | EXCELLENT |
| 58 | Swans | Gehamat Shibasaki | REACH |
| 59 | Mogpeats | Matt Burton | LUXURY |
| 60 | You | Naufahu Whyte | PUNT |

**Pick 51 — Flaps — Daniel Tupou:** Daniel Tupou at 34 years old with the FIRST PICK of round 6. Matt Burton, Haumole Olakauatu, Thomas Dearden, Viliame Kikau all available. You've picked a memory, not a footballer.

**Pick 56 — Fobs — Blaize Talagi:** SIX backs in six rounds. Historic levels of positional imbalance. Zero forwards drafted.

**Pick 59 — Mogpeats — Matt Burton:** Burton as a depth luxury. He'd start for half the teams in this draft. Obscene.

**Pick 60 — You — Naufahu Whyte:** A punt pick. At pick 60 the board is thin. You're taking a chance on upside.

> **Round 6 Winner:** Mogpeats — Burton at 59
> **Round 6 Loser:** Fobs — six backs in six rounds

---

### ROUND 7 (Picks 61-70)

| Pick | Team | Player | Verdict |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 61 | Flaps | Kodi Nikorima | DESPERATION |
| 62 | Cims | Kai Pearce-Paul | GOOD |
| 63 | Badgers | Tallis Duncan | WEAK |
| 64 | Sards | Corey Horsburgh | WEAK |
| 65 | Grunts | Bradman Best | FAIR |
| 66 | Fobs | Viliame Kikau | FINALLY |
| 67 | Shufflers | Angus Crichton | GOOD |
| 68 | Swans | Cameron Murray | NEEDED |
| 69 | Mogpeats | Alex Johnston | GOOD |
| 70 | You | Kotoni Staggs | VALUE |

**Pick 61 — Flaps — Kodi Nikorima:** SEVEN rounds of first picks to find a halfback. And it's Kodi Nikorima. From pick 1 overall. While Mitchell Moses is still available (he goes at pick 71 — Flaps' own R8 pick). You could've taken Moses HERE and had your half sorted a round earlier. Instead you went Nikorima at 61 and Moses at 71. Wasted a pick.

**Pick 66 — Fobs — Viliame Kikau:** The first forward. After SIX consecutive backs. Seven rounds overdue.

**Pick 70 — You — Kotoni Staggs:** Genuine value. A tackle-busting centre at the last pick of the round. Staggs would go 2-3 rounds earlier in most drafts. Best mid-round pick for "You."

> **Round 7 Winner:** You — Staggs at 70 is genuine value
> **Round 7 Loser:** Flaps — Nikorima at 61 when Moses was still available

---

### ROUND 8 (Picks 71-80)

| Pick | Team | Player | Verdict |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 71 | Flaps | Mitchell Moses | LIFELINE |
| 72 | Cims | Connor Watson | WEAK |
| 73 | Badgers | Jamayne Isaako | REDUNDANT |
| 74 | Sards | Nick Meaney | FAIR |
| 75 | Grunts | Trai Fuller | WEAK |
| 76 | Fobs | Brandon Smith | NEEDED |
| 77 | Shufflers | Selwyn Cobbo | VALUE |
| 78 | Swans | Jaxon Purdue | WEAK |
| 79 | Mogpeats | Christian Tuipulotu | GOOD |
| 80 | You | Sam Verrills | GAMBLE |

**Pick 71 — Flaps — Mitchell Moses:** A Test halfback with first pick of round 8. This should've been your R3 or R4 pick — the fact Moses lasted to R8 is criminal on everyone's part. But for Flaps, it's a lifeline. If you'd taken Moses at R3 instead of Valentine Holmes, your team looks completely different.

**Pick 73 — Badgers — Jamayne Isaako:** You have Reece Walsh. Why are you drafting another fullback?

**Pick 80 — You — Sam Verrills:** Last pick of R8. Your hooker. When fit, Verrills is a genuine first-grader with pace and energy. The knees are the gamble. At pick 80 there's no better hooker option left. A reasonable gamble from the last seat.

> **Round 8 Winner:** Flaps — Moses at 71 (should've been R3)
> **Round 8 Loser:** Badgers — Isaako behind Walsh

---

### ROUND 9 (Picks 81-90)

| Pick | Team | Player | Verdict |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 81 | Flaps | Josh King | FAIR |
| 82 | Cims | Briton Nikora | SOLID |
| 83 | Badgers | Ethan Strange | WEAK |
| 84 | Sards | Sua Faalogo/Jamayne Isaako | MESSY |
| 85 | Grunts | Isaiah Papalii | FAIR |
| 86 | Fobs | Jack Williams | FAIR |
| 87 | Shufflers | Bronson Xerri | HIGH RISK |
| 88 | Swans | Stefano Utoikamanu | GOOD |
| 89 | Mogpeats | Apisai Koroisau | STEAL OF THE DRAFT |
| 90 | You | Dane Gagai | VETERAN DEPTH |

**Pick 89 — Mogpeats — Apisai Koroisau:** A premiership-winning, Test-level hooker at pick 89. The single best value pick in the entire draft. Every team that drafted a back-up winger or an interchange forward before Koroisau should be ashamed.

**Pick 90 — You — Dane Gagai:** Veteran depth from the last seat. Past his prime but at pick 90, you're picking through scraps. Acceptable.

> **Round 9 Winner:** Mogpeats — Koroisau at 89
> **Round 9 Loser:** Sards — the Faalogo/Isaako mess

---

### ROUNDS 10-13 (Picks 91-130)

**Key picks of note:**

| Pick | Team | Player | Verdict |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 91 | Flaps | Adam Doueihi | INJURY RISK |
| 96 | Fobs | Tolutau Koula | 8TH BACK IN 10 ROUNDS |
| 99 | Mogpeats | Roger Tuivasa-Sheck | DEPTH LUXURY |
| 100 | You | Greg Marzhew | X-FACTOR |
| 101 | Flaps | Reed Mahoney | STEAL |
| 105 | Grunts | Zac Hosking | LAUGHABLE — STILL NO PROP |
| 114 | Sards | Chanel Harris-Tavita | HALFBACK AT PICK 114 |
| 117 | Shufflers | Thomas Flegler | LIABILITY |
| 121 | Flaps | Moeaki Fotuaika | VALUE |
| 126 | Fobs | Xavier Coates | VALUE — BUT NO PLATFORM |
| 130 | You | Teig Wilton | LAST PICK OF THE DRAFT |

**Pick 101 — Flaps — Reed Mahoney:** A starting NRL hooker at pick 101. With FIRST pick of R11. How no one else took Mahoney before round 11 is baffling. A steal, but also — Flaps had first pick every round and waited until R11 for a hooker.

**Pick 114 — Sards — Chanel Harris-Tavita:** Your starting halfback. Pick 114. From the 4th overall draft position. A player the Warriors discarded. Twelve rounds to draft a halfback. Twelve.

**Pick 130 — You — Teig Wilton:** The very last pick of the entire draft. A developing forward. There is literally nothing left. It is what it is.

### BENCH ROUNDS (R14-R17) — THE SCRAPS TABLE

> *"This is where you find out who actually understands squad depth and who's just been winging it for 13 rounds."*

**Round 14 — Bench Spot 1 (Picks 131-140)**

| Pick | Team | Player | Pos | Verdict |
|------|------|--------|-----|---------|
| 131 | Flaps | Chris Randall | 2RF | A depth forward from the Titans. Adequate bench filler, nothing more. |
| 132 | Cims | Jack DeBelin | FRF | Picking up a young forward with upside. Smart late-round value. |
| 133 | Badgers | Xavier Willison | FRF | Finally addressing the front row. Willison is a genuine NRL prop — should've come sooner. |
| 134 | Sards | John Bateman | 2RF | Bateman's body is held together with tape and stubbornness, but at pick 134 that's fine value. |
| 135 | Grunts | Shawn Blore | 2RF | Storm utility forward. Solid enough bench piece. |
| 136 | Fobs | Dominic Young | CTW | Finally! An actual good pick. Young is electric and at 136 that's a steal. |
| 137 | Shufflers | Ben Hunt | HOK | A second hooker and veteran halfback option. Smart insurance policy. |
| 138 | Swans | Tom Starling | HOK | Finally got a hooker after going 13 rounds without one. Better late than never, barely. |
| 139 | Mogpeats | Savelio Tamale | CTW | Depth winger from the Raiders. Low-risk bench stash. |
| 140 | You | Josiah Karapani | CTW | Young Broncos outside back with upside. Decent bench grab at last pick. |

**Round 15 — Bench Spot 2 (Picks 141-150)**

| Pick | Team | Player | Pos | Verdict |
|------|------|--------|-----|---------|
| 141 | Flaps | Heilum Luki | 2RF | Cowboys edge forward. More bench depth that won't move the needle. |
| 142 | Cims | Sam Stonestreet | CTW | Sharks outside back. Bench filler. |
| 143 | Badgers | Max Plath | 2RF | Dolphins forward. Deep cut bench depth. |
| 144 | Sards | Jahream Bula | FLB | A fullback at this stage suggests the Sards know Meaney alone won't cut it. |
| 145 | Grunts | Adam Reynolds | HFB | Hold on — Adam Reynolds at pick 145?! Yes he's 35 but this is genuine value if he plays. Experienced halfback as bench cover is smart. |
| 146 | Fobs | Jye Gray | FLB | A fullback when you've already got Hynes. Bench depth cover. |
| 147 | Shufflers | Campbell Graham | CTW | Bunnies centre. Reliable points scorer who adds genuine bench value. |
| 148 | Swans | Trent Loiero | 2RF | Storm second-rower. Adding forward depth at last. |
| 149 | Mogpeats | Deine Mariner | CTW | Broncos outside back. Low-stakes bench fill. |
| 150 | You | Latu Fainu | HFB | Tigers halfback as bench cover. Gives a second playmaker option. |

**Round 16 — Bench Spot 3 (Picks 151-160)**

| Pick | Team | Player | Pos | Verdict |
|------|------|--------|-----|---------|
| 151 | Flaps | Cody Walker | 5/8 | Cody Walker at pick 151! A former Origin five-eighth this late is embarrassing for everyone who passed on him. |
| 152 | Cims | Matty Nicholson | 2RF | Raiders back-rower. Solid depth signing. |
| 153 | Badgers | James Fisher-Harris | FRF | FISHER-HARRIS AT 153?! A genuine top-10 prop in the NRL falling to the bench rounds is criminal. Best value pick in the entire draft. |
| 154 | Sards | Hamish Stewart | 2RF | Dragons utility. Serviceable bench piece. |
| 155 | Grunts | Euan Aitken | CTW | Veteran centre. Reliable but unremarkable at this stage. |
| 156 | Fobs | Cameron McInnes | 2RF | Former Origin lock. At 156 this is excellent depth value. |
| 157 | Shufflers | Liam Martin | 2RF | Panthers back-rower and Origin player. Another quality player sliding way too far. |
| 158 | Swans | Jackson Ford | FRF | Warriors prop. Adding front-row depth. |
| 159 | Mogpeats | Jesse Ramien | CTW | Sharks centre. Handy bench stash for outside back cover. |
| 160 | You | Dylan Brown | HFB | Dylan Brown — a genuine starting halfback in the NRL — at pick 160 on the bench. Incredible value if he's healthy. |

**Round 17 — Bench Spot 4 (Picks 161-170)**

## TEAM SUMMARIES & RANKINGS

### 1. MOGPEATS (Pick 9) — Grade: A

| Rd | Player | Grade |
|----|--------|-------|
| R1 | Tom Trbojevic | A+ |
| R2 | Sam Walker | A |
| R3 | Joseph Tapine | A |
| R4 | Hudson Young | A |
| R5 | Addin Fonua-Blake | A |
| R6 | Matt Burton | A |
| R7 | Alex Johnston | B+ |
| R8 | Christian Tuipulotu | B+ |
| R9 | Apisai Koroisau | A+ |
| R10 | Roger Tuivasa-Sheck | B |
| R11 | Dylan Egan | C |
| R12 | Tom Gilbert | C+ |
| R13 | Clint Gutherson | B |
| R14 | Savelio Tamale | C |
| R15 | Deine Mariner | C |
| R16 | Jesse Ramien | B |
| R17 | Junior Paulo | A |

**Best pick:** Apisai Koroisau at 89 — Test hooker in round 9.
**Worst pick:** Dylan Egan at 109 — redundant second hooker.

The benchmark draft. Spine complete by round 4. Two Test props. Matt Burton as a luxury depth pick. Koroisau at 89 is the steal of the draft. From pick 9 every round — never getting first choice — they've assembled the best roster in the competition. Every other drafter should study this. The only question is Trbojevic's hamstrings — when he's in the rehab room, Walker's going missing act in big games becomes a problem. But that's nitpicking the Mona Lisa.

### 2. CIMS (Pick 2) — Grade: B+

| Rd | Player | Grade |
|----|--------|-------|
| R1 | Nathan Cleary | A+ |
| R2 | Keano Kini | C |
| R3 | Cameron Munster | A |
| R4 | Stephen Crichton | A- |
| R5 | Lehi Hopoate | C |
| R6 | Toby Couchman | D |
| R7 | Kai Pearce-Paul | B+ |
| R8 | Connor Watson | C- |
| R9 | Briton Nikora | B |
| R10 | Phillip Sami | C |
| R11 | Braidon Burns | C- |
| R12 | Robert Toia | C- |
| R13 | Leo Thompson | C |
| R14 | Jack DeBelin | C+ |
| R15 | Sam Stonestreet | C |
| R16 | Matty Nicholson | C |
| R17 | Sandon Smith | C |

**Best pick:** Nathan Cleary at 2 — the best player in the world (gifted by Flaps).
**Worst pick:** Toby Couchman at 52 — a nobody in round 6.

Cleary-Munster is the best halves pairing in the draft. Stephen Crichton is a genuine edge weapon. Kai Pearce-Paul has representative potential. But everything else — Kini, Hopoate, Couchman, Watson, Sami, Burns, Toia — is dead weight. No fullback. No recognised hooker. Two world-class players carrying 11 passengers. From the 2nd pick every round, this team should be better than it is. The middle rounds are an embarrassment.

---

### 3. SHUFFLERS (Pick 7) — Grade: B+

| Rd | Player | Grade |
|----|--------|-------|
| R1 | Scott Drinkwater | B+ |
| R2 | Jahrome Hughes | B+ |
| R3 | Ezra Mam | B+ |
| R4 | Reuben Garrick | C |
| R5 | David Fifita | B+ |
| R6 | Haumole Olakauatu | A- |
| R7 | Angus Crichton | B+ |
| R8 | Selwyn Cobbo | B |
| R9 | Bronson Xerri | C+ |
| R10 | Reece Robson | C |
| R11 | Taniela Paseka | C |
| R12 | Thomas Flegler | D |
| R13 | Reuben Cotter | C |
| R14 | Ben Hunt | B+ |
| R15 | Campbell Graham | B |
| R16 | Liam Martin | A- |
| R17 | Liam Henry | C+ |

**Best pick:** Haumole Olakauatu at 57 — wrecking ball at great value.
**Worst pick:** Reuben Garrick at 37 — a third fullback option; Thomas Flegler at 117 — gives away more penalties than he makes metres.

Smart spine strategy — three playmakers in three rounds. David Fifita, Haumole Olakauatu, and Angus Crichton give you terrifying edges. But none of Drinkwater, Hughes, or Mam is a genuine premiership-controlling halfback — you've got three sports cars and no navigator. No recognised prop until Taniela Paseka at R11. Bronson Xerri at hooker is a massive gamble after the doping ban. Thomas Flegler is actively harmful. If Xerri fires, this team's a contender. If he doesn't, there's no backup plan.

### 4. BADGERS (Pick 3) — Grade: B

| Rd | Player | Grade |
|----|--------|-------|
| R1 | Reece Walsh | A+ |
| R2 | Harry Grant | A+ |
| R3 | Sione Katoa | C |
| R4 | Keaon Koloamatangi | B+ |
| R5 | Patrick Carrigan | B+ |
| R6 | Paul Alamoti | C+ |
| R7 | Tallis Duncan | C |
| R8 | Jamayne Isaako | D |
| R9 | Ethan Strange | C- |
| R10 | Murray Taulagi | C |
| R11 | Daniel Saifiti | D |
| R12 | Josh Addo-Carr | D |
| R13 | Jordan Riki | C |
| R14 | Xavier Willison | B |
| R15 | Max Plath | C |
| R16 | James Fisher-Harris | A+ |
| R17 | Kaeo Weekes | C+ |

**Best pick:** Reece Walsh at 3 and Harry Grant at 13 — the best 1-9 combination in the draft.
**Worst pick:** Jamayne Isaako at 73 — another fullback behind Walsh; Josh Addo-Carr at 113 — cooked.

Reece Walsh and Harry Grant are an elite foundation. Keaon Koloamatangi and Patrick Carrigan give you a quality pack. Then it all falls apart. Sione Katoa at R3 when a halfback was needed is the pick that defines this draft — from that moment the team has a fatal flaw. No recognised halfback in 17 rounds. Walsh will have to do everything himself. Daniel Saifiti's body is broken. Josh Addo-Carr is a nostalgia pick. A brilliant top two picks undermined by a complete absence of planning from round 3 onwards.

### 5. SWANS (Pick 8) — Grade: B-

| Rd | Player | Grade |
|----|--------|-------|
| R1 | Jayden Campbell | B+ |
| R2 | Latrell Mitchell | A- |
| R3 | Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow | B+ |
| R4 | Kayal Iro | C |
| R5 | Daly Cherry-Evans | B |
| R6 | Gehamat Shibasaki | C- |
| R7 | Cameron Murray | B+ |
| R8 | Jaxon Purdue | C- |
| R9 | Stefano Utoikamanu | B |
| R10 | Mitchell Barnett | C |
| R11 | Jai Arrow | C |
| R12 | Trey Mooney | C- |
| R13 | Heamasini Makasini | D |
| R14 | Tom Starling | B+ |
| R15 | Trent Loiero | C+ |
| R16 | Jackson Ford | C+ |
| R17 | Joshua Curran | C |

**Best pick:** Latrell Mitchell at 18 — genuine match-winner.
**Worst pick:** Kayal Iro at 38 — fourth consecutive back when forwards were screaming.

The backline is electric — Jayden Campbell, Latrell Mitchell, Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow is as dangerous as any trio in the draft. Daly Cherry-Evans provides experience. But four backs in your first four picks from pick 8 is negligent. Cameron Murray at R7 is your ONLY quality forward. No hooker until R14 — Tom Starling finally fills the gap, but thirteen rounds without one is inexcusable. Cherry-Evans' legs are going. Gehamat Shibasaki is a reach. Jai Arrow's declining. A Ferrari backline with a lawnmower engine.

### 6. YOU (Pick 10) — Grade: B-

| Rd | Player | Grade |
|----|--------|-------|
| R1 | Tino Faasuamaleaui | B+ |
| R2 | Dylan Edwards | A- |
| R3 | Jamal Fogarty | C |
| R4 | Alexander Brimson | C |
| R5 | Erin Clark | C+ |
| R6 | Naufahu Whyte | C- |
| R7 | Kotoni Staggs | B+ |
| R8 | Sam Verrills | C+ |
| R9 | Dane Gagai | C |
| R10 | Greg Marzhew | C+ |
| R11 | Jmaine Hopgood | C |
| R12 | Brian Kelly | C |
| R13 | Teig Wilton | C |
| R14 | Josiah Karapani | C+ |
| R15 | Latu Fainu | B- |
| R16 | Dylan Brown | A |
| R17 | Max King | C+ |

**Best pick:** Dylan Edwards at 20 — premiership fullback, best available.
**Worst pick:** Alexander Brimson at 40 — Daly Cherry-Evans was still available and would've given you a proven half.

Here's the reality of picking 10th in an ordered draft: you NEVER get first choice. Every round, nine teams pick before you. By the time you're on the clock, the premium options are gone. Tino Faasuamaleaui at 10 is the best available forward after nine spine players go. Dylan Edwards at 20 is the best remaining fullback after nine teams cherry-pick ahead of you. Jamal Fogarty at 30 comes after every quality half has been snapped up.

The one genuine error is Alexander Brimson at 40 — Daly Cherry-Evans was still on the board (he lasted until pick 48) and would've been a significant upgrade as your second playmaker. But Hudson Young at 39 to Mogpeats? "You" COULDN'T have taken him — he was gone one pick earlier.

Kotoni Staggs at 70 is the best mid-round value pick for this team. Sam Verrills at 80 is a reasonable hooker gamble. The late rounds are all C-grade because by pick 100+, there's genuinely nothing left worth getting excited about.

No genuine match-winner in the squad — that's the painful truth. But from the 10th seat with zero positional advantage in any round, this is a competent draft. Not spectacular, not disastrous. A team built from leftovers that looks exactly like a team built from leftovers.

### 7. GRUNTS (Pick 5) — Grade: C+

| Rd | Player | Grade |
|----|--------|-------|
| R1 | Terrell May | C+ |
| R2 | Kalyn Ponga | A |
| R3 | Blayke Brailey | B+ |
| R4 | Fletcher Sharpe | C |
| R5 | Jaydn Su'A | C |
| R6 | Thomas Dearden | B |
| R7 | Bradman Best | C+ |
| R8 | Trai Fuller | C |
| R9 | Isaiah Papalii | C+ |
| R10 | Jake Averillo | C- |
| R11 | Zac Hosking | D |
| R12 | Lindsay Smith | C |
| R13 | Moses Suli | C- |
| R14 | Shawn Blore | C+ |
| R15 | Adam Reynolds | A |
| R16 | Euan Aitken | C |
| R17 | William Warbrick | B- |

**Best pick:** Kalyn Ponga at 15 — second-best fullback in the game.
**Worst pick:** Zac Hosking at 105 — no prop in 17 rounds and you draft Hosking; Terrell May at 5 over genuine stars.

Kalyn Ponga at 15 and Blayke Brailey at 25 give you a quality spine foundation. But Terrell May at 5 over someone like Nicho Hynes or Latrell Mitchell squanders the advantage of a top-5 pick. Thomas Dearden at R6 is too late for your halfback. No front-row prop drafted in 17 rounds — not a single one. Jaydn Su'A's discipline will cost you games. Zac Hosking is a laughable selection. From pick 5 every round, this team should be significantly better. Ponga will carry this team on his back and it still won't be enough.

### 8. FOBS (Pick 6) — Grade: C

| Rd | Player | Grade |
|----|--------|-------|
| R1 | Nicho Hynes | B+ |
| R2 | Jacob Kiraz | D |
| R3 | Dylan Lucas | C |
| R4 | Isaiah Iongi | C- |
| R5 | Brian Too | C |
| R6 | Blaize Talagi | C |
| R7 | Viliame Kikau | B |
| R8 | Brandon Smith | C+ |
| R9 | Jack Williams | C |
| R10 | Tolutau Koula | C- |
| R11 | Jake Simpkin | C |
| R12 | Leka Halasima | C |
| R13 | Xavier Coates | B |
| R14 | Dominic Young | A- |
| R15 | Jye Gray | C |
| R16 | Cameron McInnes | B+ |
| R17 | Scott Sorensen | C |

**Best pick:** Nicho Hynes at 6 — quality halfback.
**Worst pick:** Jacob Kiraz at 16 — Latrell Mitchell and Sam Walker were both still available.

The worst-constructed roster in the draft. Not the worst talent — the worst STRUCTURE. Eight backs in 10 rounds. One playmaker. No hooker. No prop. Viliame Kikau is your only forward until round 8.

Jacob Kiraz at 16 is the pivotal disaster — Latrell Mitchell went at 18 and Sam Walker at 19. Both were available when Fobs picked and both would've transformed this team. Instead you took a centre, gifted two superstars to the Swans and Mogpeats, and never recovered.

Xavier Coates at R13 is a nice winger who will never get the ball because this team has no structure, no forward pack, and nobody to create for him. A touch football team pretending to be a rugby league side.

### 9. FLAPS (Pick 1) — Grade: C-

| Rd | Player | Grade |
|----|--------|-------|
| R1 | James Tedesco | D |
| R2 | Herbie Farnworth | C |
| R3 | Valentine Holmes | C |
| R4 | Casey Mclean | C- |
| R5 | Beau Fermor | C |
| R6 | Daniel Tupou | D |
| R7 | Kodi Nikorima | D |
| R8 | Mitchell Moses | A |
| R9 | Josh King | C+ |
| R10 | Adam Doueihi | C |
| R11 | Reed Mahoney | A |
| R12 | Siua Wong | B- |
| R13 | Moeaki Fotuaika | B+ |
| R14 | Chris Randall | C |
| R15 | Heilum Luki | C |
| R16 | Cody Walker | B+ |
| R17 | Griffin Neame | C |

**Best pick:** Mitchell Moses at 71 — Test halfback in R8.
**Worst pick:** James Tedesco at 1 — the worst pick in the entire draft.

In an ordered draft, Flaps had FIRST PICK in every single round. Seventeen times they selected before anyone else. Seventeen times they had the best player available. And this is what they produced.

The first seven rounds are a catastrophe:
- **R1:** James Tedesco over Nathan Cleary
- **R2:** Herbie Farnworth over Kalyn Ponga, Sam Walker, Latrell Mitchell, Harry Grant, Cameron Munster
- **R3:** Valentine Holmes over Cameron Munster
- **R4:** Casey Mclean over Stephen Crichton, Keaon Koloamatangi, Patrick Carrigan
- **R5:** Beau Fermor over literally anyone better
- **R6:** Daniel Tupou — a 34-year-old — over Matt Burton, Haumole Olakauatu, Thomas Dearden
- **R7:** Kodi Nikorima over Kai Pearce-Paul, Viliame Kikau, Cameron Murray, when Mitchell Moses was available one round later

Mitchell Moses at R8, Reed Mahoney at R11, and Moeaki Fotuaika at R13 are all good picks that save this roster from total disaster. But the damage is done.

**The Flaps could've had:** Nathan Cleary, Kalyn Ponga, Cameron Munster, Stephen Crichton, Patrick Carrigan, Haumole Olakauatu, Cameron Murray, Mitchell Moses, Josh King, Adam Doueihi, Reed Mahoney, Siua Wong, Moeaki Fotuaika. That team wins the draft. Instead, they have James Tedesco, Herbie Farnworth, Valentine Holmes, Casey Mclean, Beau Fermor, Daniel Tupou, Kodi Nikorima. Having the best draft position and producing a bottom-3 roster is the single greatest failure in this draft's history.

### 10. SARDS (Pick 4) — Grade: D+

| Rd | Player | Grade |
|----|--------|-------|
| R1 | Payne Haas | C |
| R2 | Mark Nawaqanitawase | D |
| R3 | Taylan May | C+ |
| R4 | Jacob Preston | C- |
| R5 | Isaah Yeo | B+ |
| R6 | Lachlan Galvin | C- |
| R7 | Corey Horsburgh | D |
| R8 | Nick Meaney | C |
| R9 | Sua Faalogo/Jamayne Isaako | D |
| R10 | Wayde Egan | B- |
| R11 | Matthew Timoko | C |
| R12 | Chanel Harris-Tavita | D |
| R13 | Jeremy Marshall-King | C- |
| R14 | John Bateman | B- |
| R15 | Jahream Bula | C+ |
| R16 | Hamish Stewart | C |
| R17 | Tanah Boyd | C |

**Best pick:** Isaah Yeo at 44 — proven winner and leader.
**Worst pick:** Mark Nawaqanitawase at 14 — Kalyn Ponga was available at pick 15; Harry Grant, Latrell Mitchell, Sam Walker all still on the board.

The worst draft in the competition. From the 4th pick every round — a premium position — this team has no spine, no structure, and no plan.

Payne Haas at 4 is a prop when Ponga and Hynes are available. Mark Nawaqanitawase at 14 is a rugby convert when Ponga (literally the next pick), Mitchell, and Walker are right there. Chanel Harris-Tavita at pick 114 is your starting halfback — a player the Warriors discarded, drafted in round 12. Isaah Yeo and Wayde Egan are the only competent picks in 17 rounds.

The Faalogo/Isaako mess at R9 tells you everything about the preparation behind this draft — there was none. Payne Haas will run 200 metres every game and it won't matter because nobody within 10 metres of him knows what to do with the football.

## FINAL RANKINGS

| Rank | Team | Pick | Grade | One-Line Verdict |
|------|------|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | Mogpeats | 9th | A | Best team from 9th pick. Spine complete R4. Koroisau at 89. Junior Paulo at 169. Even in the last round they find value. Masterclass. |
| 2 | Cims | 2nd | B+ | Cleary-Munster elite. Everything else is filler. |
| 3 | Shufflers | 7th | B+ | Three spine players in three rounds. Ben Hunt and Liam Martin add serious depth. Bronson Xerri gamble. |
| 4 | Badgers | 3rd | B | Walsh-Grant untouchable. No halfback — fatal flaw. Fisher-Harris at 153 is the steal of the draft. |
| 5 | Swans | 8th | B- | Backline of dreams. Finally got a hooker (Starling) in R14. Still light on forwards. |
| 6 | You | 10th | B- | Best of a brutal hand. Last pick every round. Dylan Brown at 160 is outstanding bench value. |
| 7 | Grunts | 5th | C+ | Kalyn Ponga carrying corpses. No prop in 17 rounds. Adam Reynolds at 145 a lifeline. |
| 8 | Fobs | 6th | C | Jacob Kiraz at 16 over Mitchell/Walker. 8 backs. Dominic Young at 136 is their best pick after Hynes. |
| 9 | Flaps | 1st | C- | First pick EVERY round. Tedesco over Cleary. Farnworth over Ponga. Cody Walker at 151 is great but 16 rounds too late. Criminal. |
| 10 | Sards | 4th | D+ | Prop at 4. Mark Nawaqanitawase at 14. Halfback at 114. No plan. |

> *"The ordered draft makes one thing crystal clear: Flaps had the greatest advantage in the history of fantasy drafting — first pick, every single round, seventeen times — and produced a team that finishes 9th. Mogpeats picked 9th every round and built the best roster. 'You' picked last every round and still finished above four teams who had significantly better draft capital. That tells you everything about who understands football and who doesn't.*
>
> *To the bloke who took James Tedesco at 1 when Nathan Cleary was sitting there, and then took Herbie Farnworth at 11 when Kalyn Ponga was sitting there — mate, you haven't just cost yourself. You've gifted two generational players to other teams. That's not drafting. That's charity work."*
