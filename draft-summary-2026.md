# GUS GOULD'S DRAFT VERDICT — ONE LINE, NO MERCY

> *Ordered pick draft. 10 teams. 17 rounds. Ranked 1st to last.*

1. **Mogpeats (Pick 9) — A** — The only drafter in this competition who's actually watched a game of rugby league, building the best team from pick 9 every round while the rest of you fumbled around like reserve graders, and Junior Paulo at pick 169 in the last round proves they'd find value at a garage sale.

2. **Cims (Pick 2) — B+** — Nathan Cleary and Cameron Munster are carrying 11 blokes who wouldn't make a Canterbury Cup squad, and you've got Flaps' incompetence to thank for both of them.

3. **Shufflers (Pick 7) — B+** — Three playmakers and not one of them can actually control a game, no recognised prop in 17 rounds, but Ben Hunt and Liam Martin on the bench adds genuine depth, which almost makes up for handing your season to a hooker who got banned for doping.

4. **Badgers (Pick 3) — B** — Reece Walsh and Harry Grant is the best 1-2 foundation in the draft, James Fisher-Harris at pick 153 is the steal of the entire draft, and you still went 17 rounds without drafting a single halfback, which is like buying a Porsche, fitting it with a turbo, and forgetting to put a steering wheel in it.

5. **Swans (Pick 8) — B-** — Four backs in four rounds, two forwards total, and it took you 14 rounds to finally draft a hooker in Tom Starling at 138, and you're still relying on a 36-year-old Daly Cherry-Evans to somehow make this backline fantasy work behind a pack that wouldn't win a Group 10 grand final.

6. **You (Pick 10) — B-** — Picked last every round with no snake turn and still finished above four teams with better draft capital, Dylan Brown at pick 160 is outstanding bench value, which says more about their incompetence than your brilliance, though Daly Cherry-Evans sitting there at pick 40 while you took Alexander Brimson will haunt you.

7. **Grunts (Pick 5) — C+** — Kalyn Ponga's going to spend every Saturday night running into brick walls behind a forward pack that doesn't exist, Adam Reynolds at 145 finally gives you a recognised halfback but it took you 15 rounds to figure out you needed one, and you still went 17 rounds from pick 5 without drafting a single front-row prop.

8. **Fobs (Pick 6) — C** — Eight backs in ten rounds, Dominic Young at 136 was their best pick after Hynes but still no hooker and no prop in 17 rounds, Jacob Kiraz at pick 16 when Latrell Mitchell and Sam Walker were both still on the board — this isn't a draft, it's a cry for help.

9. **Flaps (Pick 1) — C-** — First pick every single round for seventeen rounds and you took James Tedesco over Nathan Cleary, Herbie Farnworth over Kalyn Ponga, and Valentine Holmes over Cameron Munster, then Cody Walker fell to you at 151 which is criminally late for a player of his calibre — you've single-handedly gifted three other teams their best players and produced the most catastrophic waste of draft capital in the history of fantasy football.

10. **Sards (Pick 4) — D+** — A prop at pick 4, a rugby union convert at pick 14 when Kalyn Ponga went at 15, and your starting halfback is Chanel Harris-Tavita drafted at pick 114 — there was no plan, there was no strategy, and there is no hope.
